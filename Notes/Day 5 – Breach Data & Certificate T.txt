Day 5 – Breach Data & Certificate Transparency OSINT

Target: example.com

Objective:
To identify public exposure related to certificates, leaked data, and
typo-squatting risks to understand the real-world attack potential.

Findings:

1️⃣ Certificate Transparency (crt.sh)
- Multiple certificates issued for example.com
- Wildcard certificate (*.example.com) indicates hidden subdomains
- Certificates managed by trusted authorities (Sectigo, DigiCert)
- Continuous renewal shows active and secure infrastructure management

Security Insight:
Even though core infrastructure is protected, attackers can track
certificate transparency logs to discover additional subdomains and
future changes in hosting services.

2️⃣ Breach Data Exposure (IntelligenceX)
- Thousands of results containing example.com in global breach datasets
- Includes CSV, database, email, and text file leaks
- Data presence could be exploited in phishing or spam attacks

Security Insight:
Leaked data allows attackers to harvest email addresses, impersonate
users, and deliver malware or social engineering attacks.

3️⃣ Typo-squatting & Phishing Risks (DNSTwister)
- Over 95 visually similar domains identified
- Some linked to active IPs and valid MX records
- High probability of phishing, impersonation, or scam usage
- Global infrastructure suggests widespread exploitation risk

Security Insight:
Typo-squatting remains a major threat for brand abuse and user
credential theft. These domains must be monitored and blocked.

Conclusion:
Although direct IP information is protected by CDN and DNS security,
multiple indirect attack surfaces exist through:
- Leaked data in public breaches
- Hidden infrastructure revealed by certificate logs
- Fake domains capable of phishing attacks
