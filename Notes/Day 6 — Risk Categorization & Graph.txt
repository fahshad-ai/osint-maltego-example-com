Day 6 — Risk Categorization & Graph Organization

Today, the focus was on visual structure and risk understanding of the discovered infrastructure using Maltego.

 What Was Done

Organized the Maltego graph into clear groups:

Root domain at the top

Website nodes in the middle

IP nodes at the bottom

DNS mail/infrastructure nodes on the right

Identified high–medium–low risk areas in the infrastructure

Grouped related domains and servers for better readability
