Day 7 — Final Summary and Security Recommendations

What Was Completed Today

Consolidated all OSINT findings into a structured final report

Completed risk categorization and final analysis

Added screenshots and visuals to documentation

Prepared the project for GitHub and portfolio publishing

Key Findings Recap

Several mail-related subdomains were publicly exposed, providing phishing and spoofing opportunities

Test and staging systems discovered, which can become weak entry points for attackers

Publicly visible VPN host indicates possible internal network access risk

External services referenced, introducing supply chain and trust-based vulnerabilities

OSINT alone provided enough data to plan early attack stages without any intrusive methods

Security Risks Identified

Category	Impact

Phishing & credential theft	High

Internal access attempts through VPN	High

Attackers mapping infrastructure easily	Medium

Domain impersonation (typosquatting)	High


Final Security Recommendations

Enforce DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to prevent email spoofing

Minimize exposed DNS entries not required publicly

Register high-risk typo domains and monitor domain impersonation

Conduct routine OSINT reviews to ensure reduced attack surface

Educate users on identifying common phishing tactics

Final Statement

This OSINT project demonstrates how much sensitive infrastructure information can be discovered through publicly accessible intelligence sources.
Understanding attacker reconnaissance helps organizations strengthen defenses before real-world threats exploit exposed assets.
