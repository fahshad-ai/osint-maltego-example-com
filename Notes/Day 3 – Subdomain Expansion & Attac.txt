Day 3 – Subdomain Expansion & Attack Surface Mapping

New Entities Discovered:
- Total new DNS names: 13
- Total new IP addresses: 8
- Other connected websites/domains: Yes (multiple external references)

Interesting Findings:
- Many subdomains and DNS records point to shared or multi-tenant hosting.
- Expanded infrastructure suggests widely distributed domain presence.
- Some external domains are indirectly linked, indicating network exposure.

Graph Status:
- Total entities now: 70
- Total relationships/links: Increased significantly from Day 2

Conclusion:
Attack surface successfully expanded. 
Next step: Enrich the IP addresses using Shodan and other OSINT tools 
to identify potential vulnerabilities and exposed services.
