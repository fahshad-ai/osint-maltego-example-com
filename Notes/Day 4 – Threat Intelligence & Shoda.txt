Day 4 – Threat Intelligence & Shodan OSINT Notes

Target Domain: example.com

Summary:
During Shodan and OSINT enrichment, we identified that the
target and its related services are protected using
DNS/CDN providers. Their true IP infrastructure is masked,
which is a strong security measure.

Key Findings:
- No direct IP mapping available from DNS records
- Websites and DNS names are routed through secure proxy/CDN
- Cloudflare / Akamai technologies present (security + load balancing)
- Public-facing exposure is minimized → Reduced attack surface

Threat Intelligence Insights:
- Masked origin servers prevent direct attacks on infrastructure
- Difficult for attackers to discover real hosting architecture
- Sign of industry-standard security practices

Conclusion:
Even though IP resolution is restricted, this itself is
a valuable security finding. The domain is using security
controls to protect server identity and reduce attack vectors.

Next Step:
Proceed to Day 5 – Breach Data OSINT + Certificate Transparency Search
to investigate public exposure from leaked data & certificates.
